# Backend Repository

Welcome to the backend repository for our platform. This repository contains all of the necessary code for the server-side of our platform, using Spring Boot framework with Kotlin.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, you'll need to have the following software installed on your development machine:

- Java 8 or later
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra (for databases)

You'll also need to have a local copy of the repository on your machine. Once you have that, you can install the necessary dependencies by running `gradle build` in the root of the repository.

## Running the Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running `./gradlew bootRun`. The server will be running on `http://localhost:8080/` by default, but this can be configured in the `application.properties` file.

## Dependency

- We are using Spring Boot framework with Kotlin
- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for implementing a JPA-based repository layer
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra for databases
- spring-boot-starter-security for implementing security features such as authentication and authorization
- ldap-starter for integrating with an LDAP server
- spring-boot-starter-actuator for exposing application metrics and health information
- micrometer-registry-prometheus for exposing metrics to a Prometheus server
- spring-security-oauth2-client for integrating with an OAuth 2.0 provider
- spring-kafka for integrating with a Kafka message broker

## Monitoring and alerting 

We are using spring-boot-starter-actuator for exposing application metrics and health information and micrometer-registry-prometheus for exposing metrics to a Prometheus server.

## Authentication and Authorization

We are using spring-boot-starter-security for implementing security features such as authentication and authorization, ldap-starter for integrating with an LDAP server and spring-security-oauth2-client for integrating with an OAuth 2.0 provider.

## Kafka integration

We are using spring-kafka for integrating with a Kafka message broker.
